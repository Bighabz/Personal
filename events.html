            <p>
                I am excited to announce my upcoming graduation from El Camino College in the fall of 2023. After years of dedication, hard work, and countless hours of study, I will be receiving an Associate of Science degree in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity. This achievement marks a significant milestone in my academic journey, and I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired in the real world. All are welcome to join the graduation ceremony and celebrate this momentous occasion with me.
